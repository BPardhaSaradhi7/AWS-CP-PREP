# 📅 Phase 2 — Mock Tests & Gap Fixing (05–08 Jan)

Mocks were taken from:
- Free online practice tests  
- Hard Udemy mock exams  

> **Low mock scores are not bad — they are signals.**  
> They show exactly what you need to fix.

Each mock was used to:
- Identify weak topics  
- Re-study only those  
- Improve accuracy day by day  

This final loop closes the remaining **10% gap**.

## 📊 Mock Test & Exam Performance

| Test | Score (%) | What it showed |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Mock Test 1 | 59% | Baseline — many gaps in IAM, VPC & pricing |
| Mock Test 2 | 62% | Improvement, but security & networking still weak |
| Mock Test 3 | 51% | Harder mocks exposed deeper conceptual gaps |
| Mock Test 4 | 69.02% | Near exam-level — stable understanding |

**AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)**  
🎯 **Official Exam Score: 761**

> Mock scores are not for ego — they are for **gap discovery**.  
> The goal is not 100% in mocks, but **confidence in the real exam**.

You don’t guess.  
You **measure → fix → improve → pass**.
